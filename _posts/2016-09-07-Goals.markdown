Creating a website with GitHub Pages is my reentry into programming. I'd like to earn the following stripes through this project:

- [x] Bash basics
- [x] Create a GitHub account and learn about GitHub
- [ ] Learn version control with git
- [x] Use the Homebrew package manager
- [x] Install Ruby versions via rbenv
- [x] Use Ruby gems, starting with bundler
- [x] Build a Jekyll site
- [ ] Markdown basics
- [ ] Html basics
- [ ] CSS basics
- [ ] Liquid templating with Jekyll
- [ ] Google analytics
- [ ] Ruby on Rails (may move away from GitHub Pages for this as a next step)

Content on this site might include:

- [ ] Laboratory protocols
- [ ] Topics that would help new students in biomedical laboraties understand scientific theories (ex. on CRISPR/Cas9) on a useful level
- [ ] My resume
