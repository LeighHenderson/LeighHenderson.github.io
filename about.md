As a graduate student in genetics, I mentored dozens of undergraduate, graduate, and medical students through projects in the laboratory. Along the way, I wrote out the protocols that I used to teach my students. Now I'm making that information available to *you*. I'll also post background information to help you understand how each protocol works.

I'm happiest when I'm learning/improving new protocols, and web design is my newest project, albeit *in silico*. By working on this website, I'd like to earn the following stripes:

- [x] Bash basics (no cheating with GUIs)
- [x] Version control with git and GitHub
- [x] Package management with Homebrew
- [x] Set up my Ruby development environment, starting with rbenv
- [x] Use Ruby gems
- [x] Build a website with Jekyll
- [ ] Design Liquid site templates; make available on GitHub
- [x] Write in Markdown
- [ ] Write in HTML
- [ ] CSS basics
- [ ] Improve search ranking with Google analytics

In the future, I'll learn:
- [ ] Ruby on Rails
- [ ] JavaScript

This website is currently using the Jekyll new theme at:
