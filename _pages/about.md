As a graduate student in genetics, I mentored dozens of undergraduate, graduate, and medical students through projects in the laboratory. Along the way, I wrote out protocols to help my students learn. Now I'm making that information available to *you*. I'll also post background information about how each protocol works.

I like learning new things. Web design is my current project. By working on this website, I'd like to earn the following stripes:

<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Bash basics  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Version control with git and GitHub  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Package management with Homebrew  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Set up my Ruby development environment, starting with rbenv  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Use Ruby gems  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Build a website with Jekyll  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Develop a website with Gulp  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Incorporate Autoprefixer into my Gulp development pipeline  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Write in Markdown  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Write in HTML  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Write in CSS  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Responsive, mobile-first website design  
<i class="fa fa-circle-o"> Improve search ranking with Google analytics  
<i class="fa fa-check-circle"> Design graphics in Photoshop and Inkscape  

In the future, I'll learn:

<i class="fa fa-circle-o"> Ruby on Rails  
<i class="fa fa-circle-o"> JavaScript  

All this will result in some end products:

<i class="fa fa-circle-o"> W3 Schools Certificate in HTML  
<i class="fa fa-circle-o"> W3 Schools Certificate in CSS  
<i class="fa fa-circle-o"> Design a Liquid site template; make available on GitHub
