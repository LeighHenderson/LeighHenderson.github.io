# About

As a graduate student in genetics, I mentored dozens of undergraduate, graduate, and medical students through projects in the laboratory. Along the way, I wrote out protocols to help my students learn. Now I'm making that information available to *you*. I'll also post background information about how each protocol works.

You might have noticed: I like learning new things. Web design is my newest project, albeit *in silico*. By working on this website, I'd like to earn the following stripes:

- [x] Bash basics (no cheating with GUIs)
- [x] Version control with git and GitHub
- [x] Package management with Homebrew
- [x] Set up my Ruby development environment, starting with rbenv
- [x] Use Ruby gems
- [x] Build a website with Jekyll
- [x] Write in Markdown
- [x] Write in HTML
- [x] Write in CSS
- [x] Mobile-first website design
- [ ] Improve search ranking with Google analytics

In the future, I'll learn:

- [ ] Ruby on Rails
- [ ] JavaScript

All this will result in some end products:

- [ ] W3 Schools Certificate in HTML
- [ ] W3 Schools Certificate in CSS
- [ ] Design a Liquid site template; make available on GitHub
